# PAT -- Paradigm association tool

## Resources

Dictionaries and frequency lists produced by Sergio.

## BuildDataset

Tool for building the datasets needed for training/testing the Ranker. This tool takes an Apertium dictionary in format .dix, expands all the entries in the dictionary, and detects, for each of the surface forms generated, which candidate pairs stem/paradigm could describe the surface form. The entries used to build the datasets can be filtered by defining a collection of valid lexical categories.

Two datasets can be craeated with this tool: a training set and a test set, both with the same structure. The size of each dataset is defined by setting the ratio of entries that will be used to build the training set (if the ratio is 1.0 no test set will be created). 

As mentioned above, each dataset consists of a list of JSON objects (one per line) that represent an evaluation instance. Every evaluation instance contains:
 - the surface form of the word being evaluated;
 - the gold candidate (the pair stem/paradigm defined in the dictionary); and
 - all the possible stem/paradigm candidates in the dictionary that could describe the word.

Every candidate in the JSON file consists of:
 - a stem;
 - a paradigm;
 - a lema (the representative form for this pair stem/lemma); 
 - a list of surface forms that could be generated by combining the stem and the lemma; every surface form is provided togheter with the collection of lexical information (labels) in the corresponding paradigm.

To tool is run as follows:
java -jar BuildDataset.jar -p <TRAINING_RATIO> -c <WORD_FREQUENCY_IN_CORPUS> -d <DIX_DICTIONARY> -v <LIST_OF_LEXICAL_CATEGORIES> --training-output <OUTPUT_FILE_FOR_TRAINING_SET> --test-output <OUTPUT_FILE_FOR_TRAINING_SET>
Where:
 - -p is a value between 0 and 1 that defines the ratio of the entries to be used to build the training set (if the value is set to 0, no test set is generated)
 - -c a file containing a list of word frequences such those provided in the directory Resources
 - -d Apertium dictionary in format .dix
 - -v Comma-separated list of valid lexical categories
 - --training-output File where the training dataset will be writen
 - --test-output File where the test dataset will be writen

## DictionaryAnalyser

Miquel's tool for generating candidates from a list of OOVs. A script for splitting into train and test for experiments is available as well.

## Ranker

Nikola's ranking algorithm. Start with SVR optimised with R^2, compare with SVC + probability + predict_proba.
