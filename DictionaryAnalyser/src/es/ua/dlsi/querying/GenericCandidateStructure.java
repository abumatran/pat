 * Abstract class for managing a set of candidates stem/paradigm that allows

 * any structure for helping a user (or any other oracle) determining the best
 * candidate stem/paradigm in a list of stem/paradigm candidates. The class
 * contains a set of functions for getting a surface form to be queried to the
 * oracle and a function for accepting/rejecting the surface form. In addition,
 * all the forms queried and the decision taken by the oracle about them are
 * stored in a stack and, therefore, undo operations can be performed during the
 * process of querying
